        <h1>Atmospheric Probes</h1>
        <div>
          <h3>What are they?</h3>
          <p>
            Spacecraft that are released to enter the atmosphere of another planet. Often, atmospheric probes are not designed to survive to landing on the planet surface,
            burning up in their fiery descent.
          </p>
          <h3>Purpose:</h3>
          <p>
            Collect scientific data about the planet and its atmosphere as the probe descends at hypersonic speeds
          </p>
          <h3>How is the data relayed?</h3>
          <p>
            Data from the probe is typically telemetered to the orbiter “mothership” spacecraft, where it is relayed back to
            Earth.
          </p>
          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <p>The Pioneer 13 Spacecraft (also known as Pinoeer Venus Multiprobe) carried four atmospheric
              probes to Venus in the late 1970s.
