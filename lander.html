        <h1>Lander Spacecrafts</h1>
        <div>
            <h3>What are they? </h3>
            <p>
                Lander spacecraft are designed to land on the surface of another planet or other celestial body.
            </p>
            <h3>Purpose: </h3>
            <p>
                Gather planetary data about the atmosphere patterns, surface, composition during descent 
                and after landing. 
            </p>
            <h3>Types: </h3>
            <p>
                There are two types of Lander Spacecrafts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Impact Rovers: high velocity impact, where the spacecraft obtains data during its
                        descent, but is not designed to survive the impact</li>
                    <li>Stationary Lander or Surface Rover: “soft” landing, where the spacecraft survives and is able to perform other functions
                        on the surface.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
